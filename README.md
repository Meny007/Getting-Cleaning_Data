Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This is a required project for the Coursera Data science specialization -- Getting and Cleaning Data.

For this project, the dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

All the files required for the project were eventually stored in the same folder after unzipping.

In the `CodeBook.md` the variables are described, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

The script is called `project_script.R` and it contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called `Samsung.txt`, and uploaded in the course project's form.
